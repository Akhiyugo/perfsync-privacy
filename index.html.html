    <h1>PerfSync Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>PerfSync ("the App") is a synchronized performance control app for musicians. This privacy policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Data Stored Locally (On Your Device Only)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Song database</strong> — song titles, artists, BPM, lyrics, audio file references, and setlists you create</li>
        <li><strong>App settings</strong> — theme preference, font size, language, audio channel settings</li>
        <li><strong>Device name</strong> — used to identify your device during local WiFi sessions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored only on your device and is never uploaded to any server.</p>

    <h3>Data Shared Over Local Network</h3>
    <p>When you use the Host or Client feature, your song database and session state are shared with other devices on the same local WiFi network. This data is transmitted directly between devices and does not pass through any external server.</p>

    <h3>Data Collected by Third-Party Services</h3>

    <h4>Google AdMob (Advertising)</h4>
    <p>The free version of PerfSync displays ads provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising ID</li>
        <li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>App usage data for ad personalization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising in your device's Settings > Google > Ads. For more details, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h4>Google Play Billing</h4>
    <p>If you purchase the Pro upgrade, Google Play handles the transaction. We do not collect or store any payment information. Purchase status is verified through Google Play Billing to unlock Pro features.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet</strong> — Required for displaying ads, verifying purchases, and local WiFi communication</li>
        <li><strong>WiFi State / Network State</strong> — Required for discovering and connecting to other devices on local WiFi</li>
        <li><strong>Audio File Access</strong> — Required to play audio samples you assign to songs</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong> — Required for the foreground service notification during active sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Wake Lock</strong> — Keeps the screen on during live performances</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>All app data is stored locally on your device. You can delete all data at any time using the "Clear Database" option in Settings. Uninstalling the app removes all local data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>PerfSync is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.</p>
